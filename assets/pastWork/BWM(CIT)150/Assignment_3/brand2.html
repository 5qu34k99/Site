<h2>Brand 2: Whole Foods Market</h2>
	<br/>
	
	<p><strong>Simple</strong>, the first branding concept, is an aspect of the Whole Foods Market branding scheme. 
			Whole Foods' logo is simply the company name in the color <strong>green</strong> with leaves growing from the <strong>O</strong> in whole so that it resembles a fruit.
			The slogan is reasonbly simple as well: <strong>"Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet"</strong>.
			These simple branding concepts make it easy for people to remeber Whole Foods and what the company is all about.
			</p>
		<p>Being <strong>Different</strong> is an important branding concept. 
			Whole Foods Market has a logo typical to natural/organic food stores - it incorporates the color green and/or plant imagery.
			The slogan is unique, but somewhat generic.
			Whole Foods is different is compared to most other grocery stores due to strictly offering only natural and organic products and that difference is extremely marketable.
			</p>
		
		<p>The branding concept <strong>safe</strong> is assumed in Whole Foods' branding.
			It is doubtful that people are offened by the cutesy, fruited text of the logo. 
			The slogan provides the unoffensive idea that Whole Foods Market cares about people and the planet.
			</p>
		<p>A company's branding should <strong>make a promise</strong>.
			For Whole Food's Market, this promise is quite apparent in the slogan, <strong>"Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet"</strong>.
			Whole Foods promises to its customers ideals of quality in food, quality of life, and quality of the planet.
			This ideal of quality is exemplified in the Whole Foods Market mission statement:
			<strong>"Whole Foods Market is a dynamic leader in the quality food business. 
			We are a mission-driven company that aims to set the standards of excellence for food retailers. 
			We are building a business in which high standards permeate all aspects of our company. 
			Quality is a state of mind at Whole Foods Market"</strong>.
			</p>
		
		<p>A brand should <strong>reflect the company's attributes</strong>.
			When someone reads the Whole Foods slogan, they should get a sense that they will have a healthy shopping experience that is beneficial to the planet.
			The logo also describes that the customer will experience a healthy (green, fruit) trip to the grocery store that is environmentally friendly (green).
			</p>
		
		<p>The last branding concept is that branding should <strong>reflect the company's personality</strong>.
			The personality of Whole Foods Market is that of a health oriented, go green company.
			This personality is nearly synonymous with the company logo and slogan.
			</p>
		
	
	<p>Whole Foods Market has a reasonable level of <strong>mind share</strong>.
		Both the logo and the slogan, <strong>"Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet"</strong>, are recognizable branding elements for Whole Foods Market.
		The logo is definitely more recognizable than the slogan. 
		For example, I have shopped at Whole Foods many times and will always remember the logo.
		I never knew the slogan until I researched it, but now my mind will associate it with Whole Foods.
