<h2>Brand 1: Acura</h2>
	<br/>
	<p>The first branding concept is <strong>simple</strong>. Acura's logo is the letter <strong>A</strong>, stylized inside of a circle.
			It is very similar to its parent company's (Honda) logo it just has the tips of the <strong>H</strong> folded in.
			What is simpler to remember than a letter, the first letter of the brand name, and the first letter of the alphabet at that?!
			<strong>A</strong> is also the first letter of Acura's simple, one-word slogan, <strong>"Advance"</strong>.
			</p>
		
	<p><strong>Different</strong> is the next branding concept. 
			Acura's logo isn't too different from logos of competitors as many car companies use a letter, or simply the brand name itself as the logo.
			Also, as noted in the previous paragraph, the Acura logo is almost the same as Honda's logo (though this is intentional to relate Acura to its parent brand).
			Acura's slogan isn't very different either. Many companies have one-word slogans that don't stick out.
			</p>
		
		<p>The branding concept <strong>safe</strong> is no worry for Acura.
			Not only is the letter <strong>A</strong> simple and easy to remember, it is probably one of the least offense of all the letters!
			<strong>"Advance"</strong>, the slogan for Acura, is safe too. 
			The only way it could be offensive is that it lends itself to elistism and may turn people off if they're sensitive to snobbery,
			but such folk aren't typically among Acura's target market.
			</p>
		
		<p>The brand should <strong>make a promise</strong>. Since Acura's slogan is <strong>"Advance"</strong>,
			Acura is making a promise to its shareholders to make technological advances in the auto industry,
			to always stay ahead of competitors, and to maintain or exceed quality expectations.
			Acura wants to help their consumers advance forward on the road as well as in the quality of their vehicle.
			</p>
		
		<p>The next branding concept is that the brand should <strong>reflect the company's attributes</strong>.
			Acura's branding does not give the customer a very detailed description of the experince one might expect.
			Acura's customers know that their experience will be advanced, the rest is left up to assumptions and imagintion.
			</p>
		
		<p>The final branding concept is that branding should <strong>reflect the company's personality</strong>.
			Acura is an advanced, cutting edge, manufacturer of vehicles that are affordable for being part of the luxury class.
			Acura's branding is dynamic, sleek, simple, and crafted with a purpose. 
			It lends itself well to the company's personality and reflects how the customer will feel in their Acura.
			</p>
		
	
	<p>Acura's branding does not portray a very strong <strong>mind share</strong> technique.
		While Acura does utilize the catch word <strong>"Advance"</strong>, it is too generic to keep in mind.
		Most people do not hear the word advance and identify it with Acura.
		Mind share is not something that Acura uses to gain recognition.
