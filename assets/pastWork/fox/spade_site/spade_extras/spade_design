full on collage for the colored and stamped concrete (1 collage to encompass both products).

 1 spade for radiant coils (linking to that collage).

Link the collage for stamped/colored like this:

We can also do colored or stamped concrete at an option. Then put a link that says, "click here for photos". As for the photos, I'll see if I can find some (unless you're already on your way to finding some). Go ahead and use the red stamped in the new collage.  Same with the tan one.


I've actually added another collage for you :-) ! Images are attached. This needs to go in the radiant heat coil section. Below the image you have there, put the following text:

"Don't shovel snow again! Click here to see how well radiant heat works!" and then link to the collage of the attached photos.

**content after graphics in place
	-We're also going to formulate a case by case, pro/con look at why concrete is so much better than asphalt as a finished product (i.e. concrete is permanent, asphalt constantly needs refinished; that sort of thing). I'll assume this will go on the home page to fill that blank space with some content.
	-*You'll find Sidewalks, Patios, Driveways, and Etc folders. Within those folders are a ton of photos that I scrounged up from the web. We would like you to make a collage of these photos as a single, linkable page. The style of the collage should mimic the sample I included, located in the Pitch Book Sample folder. Basically, you're going to make it look like these are individual Polaroid photos located on one page.
 	-*Bob wants this to be a "Click here to view more 'Sidewalk' photos" sort of thing from each of their perspective pages. I Would suggest taking the three spades you made on each of these pages and combine them into 1 image, add the aforementioned statement below it, and make it link to the collages you create. If you need some help interpreting this, let me know and I'll do a sample up for you.

	-and- not a link

(OK-phone numberS!<-- on every page 1 888 633 4077)

(OK- footer: no cust support email, copyright as spade concrete (notfox))

(OK- Bob also would like to see this on the homepage, sans quotes:)
	-"Our company specializes in doing work for homeowners and smaller commercial establishments. Our typical construction job is for a home owner. No job is too small, however we coordinate smaller jobs  with other work in the general neighborhood."

(OK- homepage generic pics concrete work placed neatly)
	-images on the website were framed out in the shape of a spade (basically a black spade shaped border around each picture), just to give the site some further eye-candy.

(OK- s p d - same idea (images of subject matter)

(OK- etc: on page, steps, ramps, specialty paths -- images on etc)
	Another thing to add to the "Etc." page in addition to the steps/stairs and ramps would be the addition of heating coils. We can add these in before we pour the concrete to give people heated floors.

(OK- left align logo)
