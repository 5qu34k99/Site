  			Yes, We are pleased with the New Metal Roof. So Far! We think the service before, during, and after was very good. We recamend your services to anyone we know for present and future work.
			Your sales rep. Matt was very helpful (even when I had to call on Saturdays). The roofing contractor (David) was also, very good and professional. I was impressed by their timely work schedule and long hours they put in to keep the schedule. Also we would like to mention all the other people that were involved before and to set up the job. They were also quick and efficient to keep to their schedules.
			All were nice to deal with.

			I am writing this letter to tell you how much we enjoy our new metal roof.
			Before we got our new metal roof we had three skylights and a vent in the Master Bedroom that all leaked, But since we had the new roof installed on Dec. 10th 2010 we have no problems.
			We decided to get a Burgundy roof installed and we feel it has inhanced the appearance of our hosue as well.
			Thank you for the exelent product and the pros who installed it.

  			We must admit we were a little worried about your crew coming out to install our new roof the week of Christmas. We had company coming Christmas Eve and we were worried that even if they were able to finish the roof, that cleaning up would be sacrificed or not to our standards. Boy... were we wrong!
			Your crew was very professional and kept everything cleaned up daily so when they finished around noon on Christmas Eve day and all the workers and trucks pulled out, all we were left with a fabulous looking, well insulated, metal roof. Living in a windy area, we no longer have to worry about replacing shingles and cold drafts coming in to the attic. And the charm it adds to our home... We couldn't have wished it to be any nicer.
			We continue to receive complements on our roof and are sure to tell everyone about We Do Metal Roofs.com. Thank you so much for providing a great product and great service.

  			Dear Mr. Metal! Ha Ha.
	  		Yes I love my new roof, as far as the crew putting up my new roof, you would never even know they were at my house. Everything is so clean.
			I was worried the rain would make a lot of sound on the metal roof. Not even a sound. Sometimes I don't even know it rained until I go out side. And with the summer we had it was nice not hearing it all day long.
			I'm always telling people I see need a new roof. But they all say 'Oh its too much'. But I still keep telling people about my great and most of all beautiful roof.
			Thank you. P.S. Tell Jason, I said a big Hello! (He's a great person)

  			Thank you for the $25.00 gift card I'm sure I will be receiving shortly.
 			We are very satisfied with our metal roof and have received many compliments on it. It is attractive, quiet, and leak-proof.
 			I would like to request that someone from the same construction company contact me to install additional snow-stops to another side of the roof. They were installed over our entrances, but we missed an area on the side roof, which causes an avalanche of snow to drop on our next-door township road. 
 			I would like the additional snowstops installed ASAP, so please call.

            We had our metal roof installed last winter and have been very happy with it. We saved on fuel during the winter and electric for the air condition during the summer, due to the increased insulation on the roof. The crew of three men worked efficiently to install the roof, and, even though they had to shovel snow off the roof first, the job was finished in one day. Thank you for a job well done.

  			Since our house is a century old we wanted to be sure our roof would hold up for a long time, which is why we chose a metal roof. After getting several quotes we found WeDoMetalRoofs to have the best product for the best price. And the 35 year warranty made me feel good about putting it on my home. On the day of our installation Master Force were professional and very thorough. When an architectural quirk forced a slight modification to the pre-measured roof they explained what needed to be done and why before taking any action. After they left I looked for any debris left behind and couldn't find any, which is important to a father of two small children. I have already recommended We Do Metal Roofs to my friends and family for these reasons. Thanks for great service and an excellent product.

			Approximately 1 year ago our roof was leaking in three places, so we contacted you. Master Force Construction fabricated then installed our new metal roof. The installation only took 1-1/2 days. Your men cleaned up after themselves. We now have no problem with leaks and we now have a good looking metal roof.

     		We had problems with rain coming in the original roof which was only 10 years old. Since we had the metal roof on there is no problems. We had a lot of rain and wind this year. We are very satisfied with the crew that installed the roof. People have told us our house looks better since we got the red roof. We are very satisfied with our metal roof.

			My wife and I are very please with the metal roof that you installed for us this past spring. You provided quality materials and workmanship. The workmen were polite and performed their work quietly, efficiently and cleaned up after themselves when the work was done. We appreciated the follow up by your company as well and would very much like to have you put siding on our house someday.

			I am very pleased to have hired your company to complete my home improvement project. When my wife and I purchased this home, this was one of the most important projects that needed completed as the expectancy of the roof life was drawing near its end. With our research, your company came back with the best products that we needed. Your contractor, Master Force Construction Corp., did a fantastic job in less than two days! It would have been done in a day, but, it rained. They cleaned up as they were going and when they were done, you did not know they were there. My wife and I were asked by several passerbys who did your roff and we told them, We Do Metal Roofs, was the company. They all took your number from me. They could not believe that it took less than 2 days! I still keep your number on my speed dial for anybody that drops by and asks who did my roof? Enclosing, I give you permission to use us as a reference for any potential home owners who are interested in a metal roof. We welcome there phone call.

			We are writing to let you know what we think of our metal roof. We love it! We were pleased with the service. Everyone showed up on time and got the job done in time. The job was done the way it was promised. We were very impressed with the professionalism of your company and the work crew. The workmanship was excellent. Through the hurricane this year and the large amount of rain this year, we have had NO leaks. This is exactly what we were hoping for. We are also very impressed with the guarantee that you offer. We hope to never need to use it but it is assuring to know that it is there and it was a good sales point. We certainly will recommend We Do Metal Roofs to anyone we know who are looking for a roof.

			First off, let me start by saying the crew that did our roof was very good, easy to talk to, and very polite. They also kept the work area clean and organized. Very Good. We did wait for our color of roofing a little longer than expected but all in all it was worth the wait. The roof look great. Thank you.

			Dear Tiara,
			<br/>
			I recieved your follow up letter.  We are happy to say, "we love this roof." We put up the garage in 1985, with a shingled roof.  Every time there was moderate to high winds.  We would loose shingles.  After all these years it was time to replace the shingles.  We seen the advertisement on television, "We Do Metal Roofs."  Kind of in disbelief, cause we have purchased things seen on television, and always were dissatisfied.  We decided to atleast here what the salesman had to say.  With the 30 year warranty, we decided to try it.  Needless to say, from December to the present time.  We had hard rain, hail, sleet, snow, and even high winds.  The roof is still like brand new.  Like the day it was put on.  Just wish the price could of been cheaper so we could of got the other part of the garage roof done.  Maybe, in a few years.  Thanks for not leaving us down.

			Earlier this year we had a metal roof installed on our home.  We also had a new roof constructed by your crew over an existing rear porch.  We were quite impressed by the knowledge, skill, professionalism, and demeanor of the work crew.  They knew what they were doing, worked hard and completed a quality project that not only keeps our home dry but really looks nice.. Many people have complimented us on the new roof.

			To Whom It may concern.,
			<br/>
			I would like to thank all of you, at We Do Metal Roofs, for a wonderful job that you did on our roof.  I was very impressed that everything you said in the home estimate was completely truthful.  First, our home estimate was in the pouring rain and the gentleman, Matt, our salesperson, still came to our house.  We had called and in three days, he was here.  Also, he called twice that he might be late, due to an accident on the highway.  Then, the price was great, the selection and Matts help were wonderful.  He told us that the roof would be done in three weeks.  It was done within two weeks.  In that time we got a call from the company; that, if we had a leak thye would tarp the roof till it got done.  They had stated they wanted to tarp any roof that was leaking.  So, I thought it would be awhile.  I was greatly wrong.  The roof was done ahead of schedule.  Matt thought maybe a week, they had it done in three days, no days off or goofing off.  They put their mind to work and it was done.  Thank you so much.
			As for the work, there was no mess, not even a nail.  I would not have believed that tye were even there, except we had a new metal roof.  The roof looks great.  We have had many compliments on it.
			The Best thing was we had some concerns about snow guards(did we put enough on to hold snow).  They answered my call saying they would be there soon.  They were there the next day, what service.!
			So I would like to thank Matt, all the workers and the company owner for a great job.
			Your quaility is very appreciated.

			Enclosed is out check, and another envelope is for the young man that installed the dormer window toppers I requested.  He gladly did that and I appreciate it very much.  They look great. My husband can't climb this steep roof.

			To Whom It May Concern,
			<br/>
			Just wanted to drop you all a note to say how pleased we are with our metal roof.
			Anyone that has ever dealt with a contractor can relate to some of the problems and hassles associated with that process.  In our case, we experienced none of that.  Our roof went on as promised, and the workmanship is to be admired.
			I was hard pressed to find any debis whatsoever after completion, and even received a follow up visit from a rep to make sure we were satisfied.
			While I do not anticipate needing your services ever again (at least on this house), I will be sure to recommend WEDOMETALROOFS to my friends and neighbors.
			Best wishes to you all...
